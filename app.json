    This app is built to make getting out of the house and stretching your legs fun.

    As we all know, sloth is one of the seven deadly sins. In this case it’s deadly for your sloths!
    
    You start with sloths and a step target for the day. The app tracks your steps by using a pedometer. If your daily target is reached, your snuggle of sloths grows. If you don’t hit your target, a sloth dies!

    This app was built by 6 members of the Jan 21 Makers Academy for their final group project:

    Hamish Arro 
    Ollie Bates 
    Salar Ghotaslo 
    Reeshul Shar
    Petar Simonovic 
    Dan Tyler
