# Welcome to Sloth!

## About sloth

This app is built to make getting out of the house and stretching your legs fun.

As we all know, sloth is one of the seven deadly sins. In this case it’s deadly for your sloths!

You start with sloths and a step target for the day. The app tracks your steps by using a pedometer. If your daily target is reached, your snuggle of sloths grows. If you don’t hit your target, a sloth dies!

### We hope you enjoy the app! Below are instructions on how to use the app
